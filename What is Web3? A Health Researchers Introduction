Web3 is a new phenomenon that highlights the innovative ways technology can and will further expand healthcare, focusing on prevention before treatment. 
Distinguished by its decentralized architecture based on user-focused technologies like blockchain, smart contracts, and tokenization WEb3 highlights the transformative.
Healthcare shifts centered around patient data are accessed, managed, and utilized. 
The shift towards Web3 in healthcare involves utilizing blockchain technology for decentralized data storage, thereby enhancing patient access, privacy, control, and value.  

## **A Brief History of the evolution of the web.** 
The advent of digital healthcare exemplified by electronic health records (EHRs), which digitized patient health records for easier access during the Web 1.0 era.
Decades later, the transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 emphasizes the flow of information from user-generated content, social media networks, and quicker access to information. 
Similarly, healthcare has evolved in a similar manner. Advances in technology are leading to earlier diagnoses, facilitating health communities where patients can share their stories and build support networks worldwide.
The advancement of medical information is evident through the popularity of sites like WebMD, which enables both patients and healthcare providers to access information. 
Web3, commonly reffered to as the decentralized Web, represents the next stage of the internet. It aims to establish a user-owned paradigm built on blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks, providing transparency and security.
With users able to securely interact with one another without intermediaries, Web3 is widely regarded as the "new" internet, where the end-user owns data and web-based interactions.
